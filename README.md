# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
An analysis was conducted for Pyber to show the outcome between three city types: Rural, Suburban, and Urban.  Two charts were created which one of them explains in a DataFrame the total rides, drivers, fares, and the averages.  Whereas the other chart, that shows in a line plot, the total fare by city type per month.

### DataFrame of Data Summary

The analysis of the three city types show that:
 
 1. <b>Rural</b> has a total amount of 125 rides with a total of $4,327.93 in fares for 78 drivers.  Average fare per ride is $34.62 and average fare per driver is $55.49. 
 2. <b>Suburban</b> has a total amount of 625 rides with a total of $19,356.33 in fares for 490 drivers.  Average fare per ride is $30.97 and average fare per driver is 39.50. 
 3. <b>Urban</b> has a total amount of 1,625 rides with a total of $39,854.38 in fares for 2,405 drivers. Average fare per ride is $24.53 and average fare per driver is $16.57. 
 
 ## Chart 1 Overview
 
Using Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib, an analysis was completed to display the summary of three city types.  The three city types are Rural, Suburban, and Urban.  After analyzing the data, Rural has the least amount of rides and drivers, however has the highest average fare per ride($34.62) and average fare per driver($55.49).  Urban has the most amount of rides and drivers, however has the lowest average faer per ride($24.53) and average fare per driver($16.57).  
 
A possible explanation can be because there are more drivers available for shorter drive distances in urban areas, that is why the average fare per ride and per driver is lower than rural areas.

 The analysis of the total fare by three city types show that:
 
 1. <b> Rural </b> (blue line) fares per month are $500 or below.
 2. <b> Suburban</b> (red line) fares per month are between $501 and $1,500.
 3. <b> Urban </b> (yellow) fare per month are between $1,501 and $2,500.
 
 ## Chart 2 Overview
 
Creating a line chart using "Five Thirty Eight" style, shows that the total fares by city type stays in the same range every month.  Between the months of January and April,Rural consistenly stayed $500 and below; Suburban stayed between $501 and $1,500, and Urban was between $1,501 and $2,500.
